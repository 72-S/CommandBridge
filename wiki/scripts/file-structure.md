# ðŸ§² Script File Structure

Scripts are written in **YAML format** and have a standard structure:

```yaml
name: "<command_name>"
enabled: true
ignore-permission-check: false
hide-permission-warning: false
commands:
  - command: "<command_to_execute>"
    delay: 0
    target-executor: "player|console"
    target-client-ids:
      - "server_id"
    wait-until-player-is-online: true
    check-if-executor-is-player: true
    check-if-executor-is-on-server: true
```
