Scripts are simple YAML files stored under the `CommandBridge/scripts/` folder inside your plugin directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
Scripts define **custom commands** that your players or console can use!
{% endhint %}

Each script file can register a command like `/alert` or `/lobby` with specific actions attached.
