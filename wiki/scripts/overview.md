# 📄 Overview

CommandBridge allows you to define **custom cross-server commands** called _scripts_.

Scripts let you trigger commands across Velocity and Paper servers, ideal for global actions like `/alertall`, `/hub`, or server-to-server automation.

> 🔁 Works both ways: from Paper → Velocity and Velocity → Paper.
