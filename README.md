### Installation (Short Version)

For detailed instructions, visit the [wiki](https://docs.old.huraxdax.club/) (currently outdated but new one is in progress, but the configuration is mostly the same). New one is in progess, you can read it [tho](https://docs.huraxdax.club).

1. **Add the JAR**: Place the plugin JAR in the `plugins` folder of both the Paper and Velocity servers.  
2. **Restart Servers**: Restart both servers. After the restart, a `secret.key` file will be generated in the Velocity server's `plugins/CommandBridge` folder.  
3. **Secure the Key**:  
   - Open `secret.key` on the Velocity server.  
   - Copy the key and paste it into the `secret` field in the `config.yml` of all Paper servers.  
   - **Do not share this key.**  
4. **Open a Port**:  
   - Choose an unused port for the Velocity server.  
   - Configure this port in the `config.yml` of both Velocity and Paper servers.  
5. **Set Server IP**:  
   - Find your Velocity server's IP address (plain IP, no domain).  
   - Update the `host` field in Velocity's `config.yml` and the `remote` field in all Paper servers with this IP.  
6. **Set Identifiers**:  
   - In Velocity: Set a `server-id` (any name you prefer).  
   - In Paper: Set a matching `client-id`.  
7. **Restart Order**: Restart the Velocity server **before** the Paper servers.  

After setup, you should see logs like this in the Velocity console:  
```plaintext
[21:10:10 INFO] [CommandBridge]: New connection attempt from /127.0.0.1:42918
[21:10:10 INFO] [CommandBridge]: Client authenticated successfully: /127.0.0.1:42918
[21:10:10 INFO] [CommandBridge]: Added connected client: lobby
```

Now you're ready to create scripts!
