**[v2.1.6] - 2025-03-06**  

**Changed**  
- Removed dependencies on the Paper API, making the plugin fully compatible with the Bukkit API. This allows support for a wider range of server software, including third-party platforms like Arclight that do not implement the Paper API.  
- Added a `legacy-plugin.yml` to ensure compatibility with non-Paper servers while still keeping a `paper-plugin.yml` to maintain Paper-specific features.
